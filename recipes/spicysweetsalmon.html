  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Glazed salmon that is spicy and sweet!</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1½ pounds fresh salmon fillet with skin removed </li>
    <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar </li>
    <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>¼ cup water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>⅓ cup brown sugar, packed</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place salmon in a shallow, flat dish, and set aside. Combine the vinegar, olive oil, soy sauce, water, lemon juice, red pepper flakes, onion powder, garlic powder, cilantro, and brown sugar in a blender. Blend until brown sugar dissolves. Pour the marinade over the salmon to cover evenly. Cover the dish, and refrigerate at least 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Line a broiling pan with foil. Remove salmon from marinade, and place on prepared broiling pan; season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer remaining marinade to a saucepan.</li>
    <li>Turn on broiler to low.</li>
    <li>Broil salmon about 6 inches from the heat for 5 minutes; brush with remaining marinade. Broil an additional 5 to 10 minutes, brushing 2 or 3 more times with additional marinade. Salmon is done when fish is no longer bright red and can be flaked with a fork.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, cook the remaining marinade over low heat until it thickens and reduces by one-third, 5 to 10 minutes. Use cooked marinade as a dipping sauce or drizzle over salmon just before serving.</li>
  </ol>
